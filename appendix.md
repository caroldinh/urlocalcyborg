### CUT PIECE 
Yoko Ono
> Cut
>
> This piece was performed in Kyoto, Tokyo, New York, and London. It is usually performed by Yoko Ono coming on the stage and in a sitting position, placing a pair of scissors in front of her and asking the audience to come up on the stage, one by one, and cut a portion of her clothing (anywhere they like) and take it. The performer, however, does not have to be a woman.
