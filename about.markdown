## UR LOCAL CYBORG is:

A twentysomething zinester trying to define the local new media scene (and subsequently, “local”, “new media”, “scene”, “local new media”, and “new media scene”).  

A high school student paper dropout who realized too late they would have really enjoyed art journalism.  

A computing B.S. who should have majored in English.   

Writing under the influence of (among others):  

- **MEDIA THEORY:** How can scholastic thought on mass media, digital media, gaming, remix, & beyond create language for critical engagement with art and technology? How does my undergrad required reading come into play?

- **DIY CULTURE:** How do zinesters, hackers, punk rockers, and any subculture who has engaged with the ethos of “do it yourself” shape the creation and dissemination of culture and what it means to be a “local”?

- **INSTITUTIONAL CRITIQUE:** How do the institutions and (infra-)structures that fund and curate our artwork shape the way we engage with new media art? Why do these structures exist and what are the alternatives?
