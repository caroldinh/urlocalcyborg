Last year, Lauren Lee McCarthy was scheduled to present a guest lecture at UMD. It was unfortunately cancelled, but she came back this year as part of the Art department's Visiting Artists Series. So of course I had to make the trek from my home to College Park---I am no longer a student---during rush hour, to try and at least make it before the Q&A of her 5:30 PM lecture.   

I am not going to review the lecture or the piece she had on display at the Clarvit Courtyard, "Are You The Perfect Specimen?" (part of her *Saliva* series), because I feel like I've lately gotten so hung up on trying to sound like an arts journalist that I'm not actually writing anything. But watching her presentation (and stalking her website) got me thinking about her approach to documenting her pieces, many of which are performance, event, or time/space-based. She has such a distinct style of video documentation, publishing short trailers of her experiments as if they were arthouse dystopian films.
