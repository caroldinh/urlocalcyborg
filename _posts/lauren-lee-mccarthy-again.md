*Last year, p5.js creator Lauren Lee McCarthy was scheduled to present a guest lecture at UMD. It was unfortunately cancelled, but she came back this year as part of the Art department's Visiting Artists Series. So of course I had to make the trek from my home to College Park---I am no longer a student---during rush hour, to try and at least make it before the Q&A of her 5:30 PM lecture. (It's embarassing how much I pore over her website, seeking inspiration for critical projects and also the portfolio of my sci-fi novel's media art professor character.)*  

*Despite the nature of my blog, I am not going to review the lecture or the piece she had on display at the Clarvit Courtyard, "Are You The Perfect Specimen?" (part of her* Saliva *series), because I've been so hung up on sounding like an arts journalist that I'm not giving myself the space to write anything. But watching her presentation (and stalking her website) got me thinking about her approach to documenting her pieces, many of which are performance, event, or time/space-based. She has such a distinct style of video documentation, publishing short trailers of her experiments as if they were arthouse dystopian films.*   

*I asked her about it (I talked to!! Lauren!! Lee!! McCarthy!!!!) ended up having a 15 minute conversation with my friends about documentation and all the ways it comes into our lives in the courtyard after the lecture. Have I written here yet that I'm thinking of an MLIS? I'm going to be thinking about documentation a lot.*
