The two or three people who read this blog will probably know that outside of my new-media-art-posting, I spent a good part of this year hyperfixating on Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein.* When I found out that the Shakespeare Theater Company in D.C. would be putting on a production of the gothic classic, I booked tickets right then and there. Emily Burns's stage adaptation has now completed its premiere run, and I had the pleasure of watching it on June 6 as part of the theater's Young Prose Night. Overall, I was deeply impressed by the production quality, the set and sound design, and the interplay between the script and Shelley's original prose.

Emily Burns's *Frankenstein* revolves primarily around the dialogue of Elizabeth Lavenza (Rebecca S'manga Frank) and  Victor Frankenstein (Nick Westrate), with occasional appearances by Justine Moritz (Anna Takayo), the Creature (Lucas Iverson/Jos√© Espinoza), and young Elizabeth (Monroe E. Barnes/Mila Weir). The same actors also portray Burns's original creations: characters appended to Mary Shelley's original cast as the play's plot diverges from the source material. 

While scholars can trace multiple drafts, revisions, and variations of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* manuscript, readers today will have encountered either Shelley's original 1818 publication or her 1831 revised edition, the latter being the most commonly-read in schools and pop culture. Shelley's revisions in 1831 are seemingly minor---a line here, a scene there---but overall present a different picture of Victor Frankenstein than the original. In 1831, he is a man doomed by fate, rather than the father of his own decisions. These small changes strip Victor of the agency he had in the original---likewise, while Act 1 of Emily Burns's adaptation remains loyal to Shelley's original plot, her small alterations in the timeline of the story yield more agency to her characters and more intimate insight onto their motives. 

Act I of the play bounces around the first six years of Mary Shelley's novel, from the death of Caroline Frankenstein to Victor's departure for Ingolstadt to William's death and Justine's conviction. The smaller woman-centered cast enables faithful adherence to the beginning of the novel while also giving Burns the freedom to explore these events from the domestic sphere: we never see William, or even the Creature, before intermission. While we feel their imprint in the plot, the dialogue primarily takes place within the walls of the house of Frankenstein---within Elizabeth's circle of command.

Right away, I was struck by the contemporary feel of the dialogue. Burns made it clear that we were not in for a rigid Regency reenactment but rather a feminist subversion of the original plot. Victor and Elizabeth's banter, and particularly Elizabeth's audacious back-talk, characterized the leads as twenty-somethings in the twenty-first century, even though the costumes reflect Mary Shelley's historical context. At one point, while scheming how to exonerate Justine, Victor calls for silence while he "cooks."

I imagine that Act II is the narrative that perhaps Mary Shelley would have written if she lived in the 21st century. When she first published *Frankenstein*, she wrote anonymously, likely to avoid controversy over the thought of a young woman writing something so horrific. Yet rivaling the horror of galvanism was the taboo of pregnancy --- the bood, the gore, the implication that two people had sex --- during the Victorian era. Mary Shelley had to disguise her commentary on parenthood behind a metaphor of monstrosity in order to be published at all. The idea that the novel was a metaphor for pregnancy did not occur to scholars until the 1970s, and to most people today, *Frankenstein* is a story about a monster. But Burns's argument in the adaptation is clearly conveyed in contemporary dialogue, through the classic conversation that tears couples apart to this day: to have, or not to have, children.

Someone on Reddit --- ah, yes, the pinnacle of relationship advice --- wrote that two people dating who disagree on whether or not to have children are as fundamentally incompatible as a straight woman dating a gay man. In this way, Victor and Elizabeth are fundamentally incompatible yet no different from every other couple in r/relationships that have this same problem.
