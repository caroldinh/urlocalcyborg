I was sitting in a lecture hall during my second semester of college. It was the introductory course to new media theory and culture, and my professor had just come back from a tech-art conference that was attended by mostly tech. He mentioned being on a panel and talking about his approach to coding and technology, as an artist by training. He mentioned saying something that ruffled a few engineering feathers---that every piece of code you'll ever need has already been written.   

At the time of writing---though likely, I will postpone publication until the job is done---I am working at a five-person startup in a field where funding is scarce and our neighbors are primarily academia and nonprofits. I love what we do, in theory, and we are surrounded by people advocating environmental literacy and information access. We are preceded by many-an open source citizen science platform out there, whose API is free for public use. We are developing a citizen science platform ourselves with similar structure, similar models, similar database schema. But we are building it up from scratch.   

I am the only full-time software developer, so when I say *we*, I pretty much mean *I*. And sometimes I wonder why it is that I have to break my back re-inventing a wheel that someone else is willing to share? I mean, of course I know why. It's because we're a for-profit business in a capitalist economy, and organizations whose missions align with ours are not allies but competitors. We tread warily in the non-profit world, because while we too are running on grants, our LLC status creates the impression that we have something monetary to offer to the non-profits we seek partnerships with.   

Every piece of code you'll ever need has already been written, which is why writing code with ChatGPT works. The LLM is trained on millions and millions of pre-existing permutations of programming syntax, and somewhere in those millions is the code that you'll likely need.
